class Comp extends Component{}

Object.assign(Comp.prototype,utility)

Lifting the state up

Resuability:
Mixin:
HOC: Higher Order Component
RP: Render Prop


1. class component
2. state
3. lifecycle events
4. reusability (Mixin, RP, HOC)

16.8 version: APIs --> Hooks

state hook:
1. you can have as many states as you want
2. state could be of any type: primite or reference (string, an array, a JS object)
3. setXState does not merge, BUT REPLACES the old state by the new state
4. setXState has only two versions: setXState(newState) or setXState((ps)=>{return newState});

Effect Hook:
effect hook codes get executed after rendering the react element of the component
useEffect(callback-func-to-cause-effect, dependency list)
useEffect(
   ()=>{
       //function code to cause effect
       return ()=>{
             //function code to clean up (in the next cycle) 
       }
   },
   [prop-names(s)]
)

routing: (react-router-dom)--> useHistory, useLocation, useParams
redux: (react-redux)--> useSelector, useDispatch
useState, useEffect, useRef, useMemo, useReducer etc....

ref, createRef(), callback ref, forwardRef()

scenarios:
1. focus or validate an input element
2. parent component wants to access child component members  a. class  b. function (forwardRef) 
3. you want to get reference of a component from a third party library package

parent data --> via props --> child
parent functions (callbacks) --> via props --> child --> child calls back that function-->passes arguments
